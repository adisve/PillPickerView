## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

Creating a PillPickerView

To create a pill picker, you need to follow these steps:

- Define a struct or enum that conforms to the Pill protocol. This protocol requires implementing the title property, which represents the title of each pill, as well as requiring the object to be Equatable and Hashable.

- In your SwiftUI view, create a @State or @Binding variable to hold the selected pills. For example:

```swift
@State private var selectedPills: [YourPillType] = []
```

<br>

Instantiate a PillPickerView by providing the necessary parameters, such as the list of items and the selected pills binding:

```swift
PillPickerView(
    items: yourItemList,
    selectedPills: $selectedPills
)
```

<br>

Here's an example usage of PillPickerView in a SwiftUI view:

```swift
import PillPickerView

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var selectedPills: [YourPillType] = []

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Your other content here
            
            PillPickerView(
                items: yourItemList,
                selectedPills: $selectedPills
            )
            
            // Your other content here
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, replace YourPillType with your custom pill type and yourItemList with an array of items conforming to the Pill protocol.

## ‚ú® Customization

PillPickerView offers a range of customization options to tailor the appearance of the pills to your app's design. You can customize the font, colors, animation, size, and other visual aspects of the pills by using the available modifier functions. 

The PillPickerView includes a wrapping mechanism that automatically adjusts the layout of pills to fit within the available space. If the pills exceed the horizontal width of the container, the view wraps the excess pills to a new line. This makes it easy to present a large number of pills without worrying about truncation.

You can customize the appearance of the pills by chaining the available modifier functions on the PillPickerView. For example:

<br>

```swift
PillPickerView(
    items: yourItemList,
    selectedPills: $selectedPills
)
.pillFont(.system(size: 16, weight: .semibold))
.pillSelectedForegroundColor(.white)
.pillSelectedBackgroundColor(.blue)
```

<br>

To switch between the underlying stack style for the content. Choosing `.noWrap` will invariably cause any text inside the pills to be truncated depending on length, as it will automatically be fitted inside the view and not wrap to a new line. Choosing `.wrap` will let the pills be dynamically placed an move in the PillPickerView.

```swift
.pillStackStyle(.noWrap) // Prevents pills from wrapping to a new line and being dynamic
.pillStackStyle(.wrap) // Default value. Allows pills to move in container
```

<br>

To modify the vertical or horizontal spacing in the PillPickerView

```swift
.pillViewVerticalSpacing(10)
.pillViewHorizontalSpacing(5)
```

To change the font of the pills

```swift
.pillFont(.caption)
```

<br>

You can of course chain things together to get a good layout based on your circumstances and requirements.

```swift
.pillFont(.title3)
.pillViewHorizontalSpacing(30)
```

<br>

To change the icon used by each pill when it is 'selected'.
I advise you to choose something that indicates that the pill will no longer be selected if this icon is pressed, as this is the intended behavior.

```swift
.pillSelectedIcon(Image(systemName: "xmark"))
```

<br>

To change the background color of a not selected and selected pill, respectively

```swift
.pillNormalBackgroundColor(.green)
.pillSelectedBackgroundColor(.blue)
```

<br>

To change the foreground color of a not selected and selected pill, respectively

```swift
.pillNormalForegroundColor(.orange)
.pillSelectedForegroundColor(.white)
```

<br>

The height and width of the pills can also be set, but width will be treated as the minimum width of the pills

```swift
.pillWidth(20)
.pillHeight(10)
```

<br>

Corner radius and border color can also be changed easily

```swift
.pillBorderColor(.green)
.pillCornerRadius(40)
```

<br>

You can also change the animation used when a pill is pressed or wrapped to a newline

```swift
.pillAnimation(.easeInOut)
```

<br>

Padding can also be applied

```swift
.pillPadding(10)
```
